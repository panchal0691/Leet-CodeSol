The given Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `largestValues` to find the largest value in each level of a binary tree. The binary tree is represented as a `TreeNode` structure.

Here's the approach of the code:

1. It initializes a constant `INF` with a very large value, which is used to represent negative infinity. This value is chosen to be 10^20.

2. It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the maximum values at each level of the binary tree.

3. The code defines a recursive function `recurse` that takes two parameters: `node` representing the current node in the binary tree, and `level` representing the current level in the tree. This function is used to traverse the binary tree depth-first.

4. Within the `recurse` function, it checks if the current node is `None`. If it is, it simply returns, as there's nothing to process.

5. If the current `level` is greater than or equal to the length of the `ans` list, it means we have not yet encountered this level in the tree. In this case, the code appends `-INF` to the `ans` list for that level, signifying that no maximum value has been found at this level yet.

6. It then updates the `ans[level]` with the maximum of the current `ans[level]` and the value of the current `node`.

7. Finally, it makes two recursive calls to `recurse` for the left and right children of the current `node`, incrementing the `level` by 1 in each call.

8. The code starts the recursion by calling `recurse(root, 0)` on the root of the binary tree.

9. After the recursion is completed, the `ans` list will contain the maximum values at each level of the binary tree.

Now, let's analyze the time and space complexity of the code:

Time Complexity:
- The code performs a depth-first traversal of the binary tree.
- In the worst case, it visits each node once, so the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion, which is the height of the binary tree.
- In the worst case, the space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree.
- If the binary tree is unbalanced and degenerates into a linked list, the space complexity would be O(N).
- In a balanced binary tree, the space complexity is O(log(N)), where N is the number of nodes.

In summary, the code efficiently finds the largest values at each level of the binary tree with a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity that depends on the height of the tree (O(H) in the worst case, O(log(N)) in a balanced tree).
